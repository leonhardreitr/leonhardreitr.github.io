Hi

```{r}
## Show the different plot types
x <- 0:12
y <- sin(pi/5 * x)
op <- par(mfrow = c(3,3), mar = .1+ c(2,2,3,1))
for (tp in c("p","l","b",  "c","o","h",  "s","S","n")) {
   plot(y ~ x, type = tp, main = paste0("plot(*, type = \"", tp, "\")"))
   if(tp == "S") {
      lines(x, y, type = "s", col = "red", lty = 2)
      mtext("lines(*, type = \"s\", ...)", col = "red", cex = 0.8)
   }
}
par(op)
```
