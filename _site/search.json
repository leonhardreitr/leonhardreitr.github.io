    "text": "My name is Leonhard Reiter, but most people just call me Lenni1. I am a Master Student in (Economic) Psychology at the university of Vienna and a student assistant in Robert B√∂hm‚Äôs Team. There I help with conducting research, such as creating surveys and analysing data. I did an internship at Susann Fiedler‚Äôs group at the WU Vienna where I prepared a Bachelor course on Publication Bias detection methods such as p/z-curves regarding management research.\nI am interested in how people engage, rate and interact with new technologies, ranging from vaccination to AI tool. Furthermore I am also interested in more meta-sciency topics such as p-mining, publication bias and how to help to improve science.\nMy work is strongly quantitative and I love doing and reading about statistics. Check my Github to see what I am currently working through. I am especially interested in Meta-Analysis Sometime I also dabble into Bayesian barbarism, participating in the 2024 edition of Richard McElreath‚Äôs ‚ÄúStatistical Rethinking‚Äù-Course. More broadly I am also interested in Machine Learning and text as data. I strongly advocate open-science and especially reproducible workflows. Check out my OSF to see more.\nBeside science I like to cook, play Bass and take long walks in the Augarten.\nIf you would like to talk about statistics, science in general or to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me via mail."

One of the most famous and useful plots is the forest plot, which shows the individual and summary effects.\nAnother widely used visualization tool is the funnel plot. In its core basically just a scatter plot, funnel plots\nMainly used to check the model for signs of publication bias, it plots the observed effect sizes against a measure of precision\nHowever, interpreting a standard funnel plot can be challenging. It is often difficult to differentiate between symptoms of publication bias and small-studies effects.\nThe goal of this blog post is to sway you away from standard funnel plots to embracing the sunset funnel plot."
