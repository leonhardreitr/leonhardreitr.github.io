    "text": "My name is Leonhard Reiter, but most people just call me Lenni1. I am a Phd Student in Marketing at the university of Vienna\nBefore I studied Psychology (M.Sc) and was a student assistant in Robert B√∂hm‚Äôs Team. There I helped with conducting research, such as creating surveys and analyzing data.\nI did an internship at Susann Fiedler‚Äôs group at the WU Vienna where I prepared a Bachelor course on Publication Bias detection methods such as p/z-curves regarding management research.\nI am interested in how people engage, rate and interact with new technologies, ranging from vaccination to AI tool. Furthermore I am also interested in more meta-sciency topics such as p-mining, publication bias and how to help to improve science.\nMy work is strongly quantitative and I love doing and reading about statistics. Check my Github to see what I am currently working through.\nSometime I also dabble into Bayesian barbarism, participating in the 2024 edition of Richard McElreath‚Äôs ‚ÄúStatistical Rethinking‚Äù-Course. More broadly I am interested in meta-analyses, mixed-effects models, Machine Learning and text as data. I strongly advocate open-science and especially reproducible workflows. Check out my OSF to see more.\nBeside science I am an avid martial artis (Purple Belt in BJJ), like to cook, play Bass and take long walks in the Augarten.\nIf you would like to talk about statistics, science in general or to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me via mail."
