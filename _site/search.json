    "text": "My name is Leonhard Reiter, but most people just call me Lenni (with an “i”, not an “y”). I am a Master Student in (Economic) Psychology at the university of Vienna and a student assistant in Robert Böhm’s Team. There I help with conducting research, such as creating surveys and analysing data. I did an internship at Susann Fiedler’s group at the WU Vienna where I prepared a Bachelor course on Publication Bias detection methods such as p/z-curves regarding management research.\nHowever I am also doing research myself. I am primarily interested in AI-Human interaction, it’s perception and general attitudes towards novel technologies. Furthermore I am also interested in more meta-sciency topics such as p-mining, publication bias and how to help to improve science.\nMy work is strongly quantitative and I love doing and reading about statistics. Check my Github to see what I am currently working through. Lately I have been head-over-toes into Bayesian barbarism, participating in the 2024 edition of Richard McElreath’s “Statistical Rethinking”-Course. More broadly I am also interested in Meta-Analysis, Machine Learning and text as data. I strongly advocate open-science and especially reproducible workflows. Check out my OSF to see more.\nIf you would like to talk about statistics, science in general or to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me via mail."
