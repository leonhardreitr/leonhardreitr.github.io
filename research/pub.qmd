## Work in progress

::: {#in-progress}
I am currently working on a meta-analysis on a topic related to vaccination intention. My first article as first author is also currently under review. The topic is broadly use cases of generative AI in education. I am further also working on projects regarding drivers of AI aversion and reactance to S-Frame policies.
