One of the\nmost famous and useful plots is the forest plot, which shows the individual and summary effects.\n\nAnother widely used visualization tool is the funnel plot. In its core basically just a scatter plot, funnel plots \n\n\n\nMainly used to check the model for signs of\npublication bias, it plots the observed effect sizes against a measure of precision\n\nHowever,  interpreting a standard funnel plot can be challenging.\nIt is often difficult to differentiate between symptoms of publication bias and\nsmall-studies effects.\n\nThe goal of this blog post is to sway you away from standard funnel plots to embracing the sunset funnel plot.\n\n### Enhancing Funnel plots\n\n\n\n## Creating a Sunset Funnel Plot\n\nMaking a sunset funnel plot is easy and straight forward. The `metaviz` package by @Kossmeier2020 provides a straight forward function for it: `viz_sunset()`.\n\nWhen using `metafor` [@metafor] to fit a model, you can then just feed it to `viz_sunset()`.\n\n\n## Further otuputs\n\n`viz_sunset()` also provides multiple estimates for the power.\n\n\nBeside values for the mean power `viz_funnel` further provides two estimates:\n\n- A test of excessive significance [@tes]\n\n- The R-Index \n\n### Test of excessive significance\n\nFirst proposed by @tes, the test for an excess of significant findings aims to do\nprecisely that, to tell one, if the number of significant results \n\n$$\nz_i = \\frac{y_i - \\mbox{H}_0}{\\sqrt{v_i}}\n$$\n\n\n### R-Index\n\n\n\n# Conclusion \n\n# References",
