Interpreting the results of a meta-analysis means interpreting graphs. One of the
most famous and useful plots is the forest plot, which shows the individual and summary effects.

Another widely used visualization tool is the funnel plot. In its core basically just a scatter plot, funnel plots 



Mainly used to check the model for signs of
publication bias, it plots the observed effect sizes against a measure of precision

However,  interpreting a standard funnel plot can be challenging.
It is often difficult to differentiate between symptoms of publication bias and
small-studies effects.

The goal of this blog post is to sway you away from standard funnel plots to embracing the sunset funnel plot.

### Enhancing Funnel plots



## Creating a Sunset Funnel Plot

Making a sunset funnel plot is easy and straight forward. The `metaviz` package by @Kossmeier2020 provides a straight forward function for it: `viz_sunset()`.

When using `metafor` [@metafor] to fit a model, you can then just feed it to `viz_sunset()`.


## Further otuputs

`viz_sunset()` also provides multiple estimates for the power.


Beside values for the mean power `viz_funnel` further provides two estimates:

- A test of excessive significance [@tes]

- The R-Index 

### Test of excessive significance

First proposed by @tes, the test for an excess of significant findings aims to do
precisely that, to tell one, if the number of significant results 

$$
z_i = \frac{y_i - \mbox{H}_0}{\sqrt{v_i}}
$$


### R-Index
