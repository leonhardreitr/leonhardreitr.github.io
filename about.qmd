title: "About me"
---
My name is Leonhard Reiter.
I am Master Student in (Economic) Psychology and a Student Assistant in Robert BÃ¶hm's Team.
There I help with conducting research, such as creating survey and
analysing data. I did an Internship at Susann Fiedlers Group where I preprared a
Bachelor course on Publication Bias detection methods such as p/z-curves regarding 
managment research.

However I am also doing research myself. I am primarly interested in AI-Human interaction, it's perception
and general attitudes towards novel technologies. Furthermore I am also interested in more
meta-sciency topics such as p-mining, publication bias and how to help to improve science.

My work is strongly quantitative and I love doing and reading about statistics.
Check my Github to see what I am currently working through. Lately I have been
head-over-toes into Bayesian barbarism, participating in the 2024 edition of 
Richard McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking"-Course. More broadly I am also interested 
in Meta-Analysis, Machine Learning and text as data. 
I strongly advocate open-science and especialy reproducible workflows. Check out my
OSF to see more.

If you would like to talk about statistics, science in general or to collaborate on a project,
feel free to reach out to me via mail
