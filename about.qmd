My name is Leonhard Reiter, but most people just call me Lenni[^1]. I am
a PhD student and pre-doctoral researcher in Marketing Management at the
University of Vienna. My advisor is Christoph Fuchs.

[^1]: With an "i" not a "y"

I am interested in how people engage, evaluate and interact with new
technologies, ranging from algorithms to vaccines. I am also interested
in more meta-scientific topics such as research synthesis, publication
bias, and how to improve science as a whole. My research has been
featured in popular media such as the [Forbes
magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2024/03/15/3-ways-to-use-ai-for-strategic-decision-making/).
I strongly advocate for open-science and especially reproducible
workflows. Check out my OSF to see more.

My work is heavily quantitative and I love doing and reading about
statistics. I am interested in meta-analysis, mixed effects models,
machine learning, and text as data. Check out my Github to see what book
I am currently working through.

Before starting my PhD, I studied psychology at the University of Vienna
(M.Sc.) and worked as a student assistant in Robert BÃ¶hm's team. There I
helped with research, such as creating surveys and analyzing data.

I did an internship in Susann Fiedler's group at the Vienna University
of Economics and Business, where I prepared a bachelor course on
publication bias detection methods like p/z-curves in management
research.

Besides science, I am an avid martial artist (Purple Belt in Brazilian
Jiu-Jitsu), I like to cook, play bass and take long walks in the
[Augarten](https://de.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Wien/Leopoldstadt/Augarten#/media/Datei:Augarten_Flakturm.jpg).

If you want to talk about statistics, science in general, or collaborate
on a project, feel free to drop me a line via
