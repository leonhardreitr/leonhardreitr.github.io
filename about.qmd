My name is Leonhard Reiter, but most people just call me Lenni[^1]. I am
a Phd-student and pre-doctoral researcher in Marketing at the University
of Vienna. My supervisor is Christoph Fuchs.

[^1]: With an "i" not a "y"

I am interested in how people engage, rate and interact with new
technologies, ranging from algorithms to vaccines. Furthermore I am also
interested in more meta-sciency topics such as p-mining, publication
bias and how to help to improve science as a whole. My research was
featured in popular media such as the [Forbes
magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2024/03/15/3-ways-to-use-ai-for-strategic-decision-making/).
I strongly advocate for open-science and especially reproducible
workflows. Check out my OSF to see more.

My work is strongly quantitative and I love doing and reading about
statistics. I am interested in meta-analyses, mixed-effects models,
Machine Learning and text as data. Check my Github to see what book I am
currently working through.

Before I started my Phd, I studied Psychology at the University of
Vienna (M.Sc), while also being a student assistant in Robert BÃ¶hm's
Team. There I helped with conducting research, such as creating surveys
and analyzing data.

I did an internship at Susann Fiedler's group at the WU Vienna where I
prepared a Bachelor course on Publication Bias detection methods such as
p/z-curves regarding management research.

Beside science I am an avid martial artist (Purple Belt in Brazilian
Jiu-Jitsu), like to cook, play Bass and take long walks in the
[Augarten](https://de.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Wien/Leopoldstadt/Augarten#/media/Datei:Augarten_Flakturm.jpg).

If you would like to talk about statistics, science in general or to
collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me via
