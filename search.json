    "text": "My name is Leonhard Reiter, but most people just call me Lenni1. I am a PhD student and pre-doctoral researcher in Marketing Management at the University of Vienna. My advisor is Christoph Fuchs.\nI am interested in how people engage, evaluate and interact with new technologies, ranging from algorithms to vaccines. I am also interested in more meta-scientific topics such as research synthesis, publication bias, and how to improve science as a whole. My research has been featured in popular media such as the Forbes magazine. I strongly advocate for open-science and especially reproducible workflows. Check out my OSF to see more.\nMy work is heavily quantitative and I love doing and reading about statistics. I am interested in meta-analysis, mixed effects models, machine learning, and text as data. Check out my Github to see what book I am currently working through.\nBefore starting my PhD, I studied psychology at the University of Vienna (M.Sc.) and worked as a student assistant in Robert Böhm’s team. There I helped with research, such as creating surveys and analyzing data.\nI did an internship in Susann Fiedler’s group at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, where I prepared a bachelor course on publication bias detection methods like p/z-curves in management research.\nBesides science, I am an avid martial artist (Purple Belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu), I like to cook, play bass and take long walks in the Augarten.\nIf you want to talk about statistics, science in general, or collaborate on a project, feel free to drop me a line via mail."
