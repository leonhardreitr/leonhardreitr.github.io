    "text": "My name is Leonhard Reiter, but most people just call me Lenni1. I am a Phd-student and pre-doctoral researcher in Marketing at the University of Vienna. My supervisor is Christoph Fuchs.\nI am interested in how people engage, rate and interact with new technologies, ranging from algorithms to vaccines. Furthermore I am also interested in more meta-sciency topics such as p-mining, publication bias and how to help to improve science as a whole. My research was featured in popular media such as the Forbes magazine. I strongly advocate for open-science and especially reproducible workflows. Check out my OSF to see more.\nMy work is strongly quantitative and I love doing and reading about statistics. I am interested in meta-analyses, mixed-effects models, Machine Learning and text as data. Check my Github to see what book I am currently working through.\nBefore I started my Phd, I studied Psychology at the University of Vienna (M.Sc), while also being a student assistant in Robert B√∂hm‚Äôs Team. There I helped with conducting research, such as creating surveys and analyzing data.\nI did an internship at Susann Fiedler‚Äôs group at the WU Vienna where I prepared a Bachelor course on Publication Bias detection methods such as p/z-curves regarding management research.\nBeside science I am an avid martial artist (Purple Belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu), like to cook, play Bass and take long walks in the Augarten.\nIf you would like to talk about statistics, science in general or to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me via mail."
